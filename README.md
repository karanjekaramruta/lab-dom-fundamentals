# Extra Dom Assignment

To practice the foundations of DOM manipulation here's an extra assignment.

## Iteration 1

Select the `<h1>` tag and make it say hello class!

## Iteration 2

By using DOM manipulation, add a `<p>` tag to the body and set it's content to "Today we're going to solidify our DOM skills!".

## Iteration 3

Loop over all the students in the `./script.js` files and create  a `<h3>` element for each of them with their first and last name.

## Iteration 4

There's an image set up for every student. They are hosted on `https://wd-ft-feb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/`. You can find the image of the student by lowercasing the firstname and adding it to the url. Elena's picture is for example hosted on `https://wd-ft-feb.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/alena.png`. You have to create an image and set the attribute. Use the documentation on mozilla or w3schools if you forgot how to change te attribute of an html tag.

## Iteration 5

These's images are a bit big and they need a little picture frame. Change the styling by using dom manipulation. Set the width to `200px` and the border to `5px solid black`.


## Iteration 6

Create a button straight in the HTML. It should say "Choose favorite student". If you click on this button, a favorite student should be picked out at random (we don't have any real favorites ^^). Make that student appear at the top of the page. If you click on that button again, a new student should be picked out.
